# Dashboard Exercise

The dashboard exercise provide simple list of projects and a functionality which makes it possible for you to create them. There is a search functionality as well.

## Installation

```
3) Start the project with the following command:

```

## Description 

I used Simple react js with scoped scss to create the application. I also used redux for the search functionality. The react router was used as well to provide single page interactivity into the application. It was all written into a modern react syntax without the usage of class components. I really hope you like it.
